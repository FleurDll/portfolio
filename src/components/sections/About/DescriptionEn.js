        <AboutDescription>
            I'm a 25 years old <DescriptionSpan>web developer</DescriptionSpan> from France, although I grew up between different countries. I'm currently preparing for my future destination: <DescriptionSpan>Canada</DescriptionSpan>.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Starting with a psychology diploma, I've always been curious to learn more about computer science.
            And just like that, late Novembre 2020 I started learning Python. I guess I liked it because I never stopped since then, oops. Specializing myself in the <DescriptionSpan>MERN stack</DescriptionSpan> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            This new path allows me to join my <DescriptionSpan>logical</DescriptionSpan> and <DescriptionSpan>creative</DescriptionSpan> sides. I always push my learnings further and never give up. Well, in short, i'm having a lot of <DescriptionSpan>fun</DescriptionSpan>.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            If not coding, you can find me being walked by my dog Hilda, on my bike, ​​or climbing houses in Assassin's Creed games.
