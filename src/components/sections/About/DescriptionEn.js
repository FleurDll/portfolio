        <AboutDescription>
            I'm a 25 years old <DescriptionSpan>web developer</DescriptionSpan> from France, although I grew up between different countries. I'm currently preparing for my future destination: Canada.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Starting with a psychology diploma, I've always been curious to learn more about computer science.
            And just like that, late Novembre 2020 I started learning Python. I guess I too was struck by the passion for code, oops. I never stopped since then, specializing myself in the <DescriptionSpan>MERN stack</DescriptionSpan>.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My needs for <DescriptionSpan>logic</DescriptionSpan>, <DescriptionSpan>structure</DescriptionSpan> and <DescriptionSpan>creativity</DescriptionSpan> are finally fulfilled by this new path. I always push my learnings further and never give up. Well, in short, i'm having a lot of fun.

            If not coding in front of my screen, you can find me being walked by my dog Hilda, on my bike, ​​or climbing houses in Assassin's Creed games.
